# üß† Introduction

The **STM32G4 series**, like most microcontrollers, provides access to GPIO ports through **memory-mapped registers**. One of the most valuable lessons I‚Äôve learned through this project is how to navigate and interpret the **reference manual** and **datasheet** ‚Äî both essential tools for bare-metal development.

Although I‚Äôve worked with other microcontrollers before, this was my first experience using ST‚Äôs ecosystem. I was curious to see how they structure their technical documentation, and I quickly realized just how critical it is to read beyond just the GPIO chapter.

## üí° Why Bare-Metal?

Since this project is called **`baremetal-blink`**, my goal from the start was to work *without* relying on STM32CubeMX, HAL, or any abstraction layers. I wanted full control and a deeper understanding of how the microcontroller works at the register level.

## üéØ What I Set Out to Do

My first task was to blink the onboard LED connected to **PA5** (Port A, Pin 5) on the Nucleo-G431RB board. Once that was working, I added **PA1** just to explore configuring another pin ‚Äî even though it isn‚Äôt connected to anything on the board.

This decision helped me reason about:

- How to configure GPIO pins manually
- How to use **bit masking** to modify specific register fields
- How to verify pin behavior even without a visible output

## üìö Understanding the Documentation

Initially, I dove into **Chapter 9** of the reference manual, which covers GPIO configuration. But I quickly hit a wall trying to figure out where register addresses actually came from. That led me to explore:

- **Chapter 2: System and Memory Overview**

- **Chapter 7: Reset and clock control**

- **GPIO register maps and offsets**

Understanding the **address offset + base address** concept was a turning point. Once I could calculate the address of something like `GPIOA_MODER`, it became much easier to reason about bit manipulation.

## üõ†Ô∏è The Role of Bit Masking

Almost everything in this project boils down to manipulating bits:
- Setting two bits to select a mode
- Clearing bits before updating a field
- Toggling a specific bit with XOR

I relied heavily on shifting (`1 << N`), masking (`&= ~mask`), and setting (`|= mask`) techniques. It felt like building logic gates manually ‚Äî which is exactly what makes bare-metal programming so satisfying.

In the code sections that follow, I‚Äôve added comments to explain *where* each value came from, including references to the specific manual sections that informed each choice. It‚Äôs very much a **trial-and-error narrative**, and I hope it helps others understand the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind the bit-level work.

## ðŸ“– Hello Reader

In this simple project, I'm going on a journey to blink an LED.

It's the "Hello, World!" of embedded software developmentâ€”and a great way to revisit some fundamentals. I'm writing this after completing the code, so think of it as a review of what I learned.

I'm working with an STM32G4431 on a Nucleo development board, writing bare-metal C without relying on HAL or CubeMX. And yes, I used AI along the way to help answer a few questionsâ€”because why not use the tools we have?

Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™ve documented:

- [ðŸ”Œ How GPIO Configuration Works](docs/gpio_setup.md)
- [ðŸ•’ Why the LED Blinks Without a Clock Setup](docs/clock_config.md)
- [ðŸŽ¥ A Blinkinâ€™ Video](https://youtu.be/EhbUuldCprk)

Feel free to explore the links and see how it all comes together.

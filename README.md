## 📖 Hello Reader

In this simple project, I'm going on a journey to blink an LED.

It's the "Hello, World!" of embedded software development—and a great way to revisit some fundamentals. I'm writing this after completing the code, so think of it as a review of what I learned.

I'm working with an STM32G4431 on a Nucleo development board, writing bare-metal C without relying on HAL or CubeMX. And yes, I used AI along the way to help answer a few questions—because why not use the tools we have?

Here’s what I’ve documented:

- [🔌 How GPIO Configuration Works](docs/gpio_setup.md)
- [🕒 Why the LED Blinks Without a Clock Setup](docs/clock_config.md)
- [🎥 A Blinkin’ Video](https://youtu.be/EhbUuldCprk)

Feel free to explore the links and see how it all comes together.

I've returned about 5 months later to add the most difficult of difficult things serial outputs and reading a senser, so the project is going to have the format

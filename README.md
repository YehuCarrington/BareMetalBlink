## ðŸ“– Hello Reader.

In this very simple project I'm going to be going on a journey to blink and LED.
It's the hello world of the Embedded Software Space. But enough Rambling from me. use the link below to see what I learned.

P.S. I'm developing on a STM32G4431. I'm using the Nucleo development board. 
Also I'm writing this after I completed the code so it should be a review of what I learned.
Yes, I did use AI to help me find answers to some of the questions I had.
